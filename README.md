## Introduction

### SRAM :
Static Random Access Memory, commonly known as SRAM, is a fundamental type of semiconductor memory used extensively in modern digital electronic systems. Unlike dynamic RAM (DRAM), which requires periodic refreshing, SRAM is static in nature, meaning it holds data as long as power is supplied.

Applications of SRAM include serving as cache memory in microprocessors, providing high-speed storage for critical data and instructions, and acting as the primary memory in various embedded systems where fast and reliable access to data is essential. SRAM is favored for its fast read and write access times, making it a crucial component in optimizing the performance of various electronic devices.
